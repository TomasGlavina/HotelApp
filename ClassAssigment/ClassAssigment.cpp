/*Hi, I am Tomás Glavinaand this is my Hotel Room Reservation project, I aim to the 5 so the program will be according to the requirements.
Aswell, I will add some functionalities
The program works as a Hotel program where the user gets the option to reserve a room, 
the user can check before hand if the specific room is available and also the user gets the choice
to check out, if the user knows the booking number reservation, which is printed in the invoice (it is assumed in this project that 
 the user pays automatically the invoice) and lastly, the user can print the invoice before the check out, if he/she wishes so. */
